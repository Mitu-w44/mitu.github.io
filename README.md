    <h1> <u>Product B</u> </h1>
  <ul>
    <li>hard</li>
    <li>vibration</li>
    <li>waterproof</li>
  </ul>
    <p>the <em>importance</em> of having B is to <cite>pleasure yourself</cite>. For example B junior once said:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"I dont have a <cite>boifriend</cite>, therefore I have product B" </p>
      </blockquote>
    <p>smart to note that B junior <strong>is fucking ugly</strong> </p>
    <p>In fact. why are a lot of us ugly, yet some are beautiful.<br>
    Maybe because life is unfair?<br>
    Because B has ugly parents, yet <mark>the creator</mark> has pretty parents.<br>
    However, life is not as unfair as you may think,<br>
    B's mom looks like a dork but she is kind by heart,<br>
    <mark>the creator</mark>'s mom is a motherfucking bitch with mid-boobs.<br>
    You see, we may not be able to decide how we are born,<br>
    but can we become rich and change how we look <strong>permanently</strong>...thanks to cosmetic surgery</p>
